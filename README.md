# Dear Instructor

I would like to inform you that I will be working on the Checkpoint Project individually and will not be choosing a partner. I am ready to proceed with selecting a project topic and would appreciate your guidance in making this decision.

The commercial site I have chosen for my project is an online store . This platform will allow users to browse, search, and purchase books from various genres and categories. The site will include features such as user registration and login, product listings with detailed descriptions and images, a shopping cart system, and secure payment integration. Additionally, it will support customer reviews and ratings for each book, helping other users make informed purchasing decisions. The overall goal of the project is to create a user-friendly and functional e-commerce website that simulates a real-world online retail experience.

Please let me know if there are any additional requirements or suggestions you would like me to consider before proceeding with the Lab Phase.

Thank you.
